## List of Currency Exchange Rates

This site has a table to show the exchange rates of a list of 61 currencies (including cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies) to a unit of Bitcoin. The backend API is provided by Coingecko via a static link: [https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/exchange_rates](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/exchange_rates). This frontend is built using React js with the responsive design in mind.
